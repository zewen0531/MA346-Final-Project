For the dashboard, we cannot log into Heroku, because we need to use VPN to log into Heroku, but we cannot go to the same IP address as the first time we logged in. As a result, we cannot accomplish the dashboard steps. For the effort, you can see we have already completed the first three steps by seeing the three text files in the repo. To acess the Dashboard, you can go ahead to download the python file called app.py and run. We are sorry for any inconvenience. If you need more infromation or have any questions, please don't hesistate to contact us at li_zewe@bentley.edu or ding_yu@bentley.edu.
